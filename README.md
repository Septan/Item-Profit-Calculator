# Item Profit Calculator

This program calculates the total price of items owned by the user and compares the profit from selling at two different locations: the market and the barn.

## Features

- Calculates the total price of various items such as fruits, vegetables, flowers, and animal products.
- Calculates the percentage of the total sell price that the total price of all items represents for both the market and the barn.
- Compares the two percentages to determine which location provides a better profit.
- Suggests selling at the barn if the percentage of the total sell price is higher for the barn, and at the market if it is higher for the market.
- If the percentages are the same, the program says it doesn't matter where the user sells their items.

In addition, the program also has a feature that calculates the total price of items on an adventure island and compares the profit from selling at the adventure market and the barn.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No additional packages or modules are required.
